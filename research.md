Our lab's current research centers on designing collaborative frameworks that integrate Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), with human intelligence (HI) to tackle complex, real-world problems in social contexts. Human intelligence contributes unique capabilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, abstract thinking, and the ability to learn from experience. These attributes provide valuable context, domain expertise, and human-centered insights essential for understanding the intricate social and environmental factors that shape societies. Conversely, GenAI excels at processing large-scale data, identifying latent patterns, and making predictions, offering scalability and computational power for addressing complex issues.

Motivated by the complementary yet distinct strengths of GenAI and HI, our lab's research is built upon three core thrusts: human-AI collaborative *design*, *calibration*, and *interaction*.

- The *design* thrust leverages human-in-the-loop mechanisms to optimize neural architectures and hyperparameters efficiently, focusing on adaptive solutions for resource-constrained scenarios such as disaster response and urban monitoring.
- The *calibration* thrust addresses adaptability, robustness, and cross-domain generalization by integrating GenAI and human intelligence through collective intelligence frameworks, ensuring alignment with diverse and dynamic domain requirements.
- The *interaction* thrust fosters seamless collaboration between humans and GenAI, integrating small and large language models with HI to maintain explainability, interpretability, and responsiveness in high-stakes applications.

**<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-90080-8" target="_blank">Social Intelligence: The New Frontier of Integrating Human Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence in Social Space, 1st Edition</a>**  
**Authors:** Dong Wang, Lanyu Shang, Yang Zhang  
**Publisher:** Springer Nature
**Publication Year:** 2025  

**About this book:**  Given the rise of AI and the advent of online collaboration opportunities (e.g., social media, crowdsourcing), emerging research has started to investigate the integration of AI and human intelligence, especially in a collaborative social context. This creates unprecedented challenges and opportunities in the field of Social Intelligence (SI), where the goal is to explore the collective intelligence of both humans and machines by understanding their complementary strengths and interactions in the social space.

In this book, a set of novel human-centered AI techniques are presented to address the challenges of social intelligence applications, including multimodal approaches, robust and generalizable frameworks, and socially empowered explainable AI designs. The book then presents several human-AI collaborative learning frameworks that jointly integrate the strengths of crowd wisdom and AI to address the limitations inherent in standalone solutions. The book also emphasizes pressing societal issues in the realm of social intelligence, such as fairness, bias, and privacy. Real-world case studies from different applications in social intelligence are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in achieving substantial performance gains in various aspects, such as prediction accuracy, model generalizability and explainability, algorithmic fairness, and system robustness.
