    My current research centers on designing collaborative frameworks that integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), with human intelligence (HI) to tackle complex, real-world problems in social contexts. Human intelligence contributes unique capabilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, abstract thinking, and the ability to learn from experience. These attributes provide valuable context, domain expertise, and human-centered insights essential for understanding the intricate social and environmental factors that shape societies. Conversely, AI excels at processing large-scale data, identifying latent patterns, and making predictions, offering scalability and computational power for addressing complex issues.

    <p>
    Motivated by the complementary yet distinct strengths of AI and HI, my research is built upon three core thrusts: human-AI collaborative <em>design</em>, <em>calibration</em>, and <em>interaction</em>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design</strong>: Leverages human-in-the-loop mechanisms to optimize neural architectures and hyperparameters efficiently, focusing on adaptive solutions for resource-constrained scenarios such as disaster response and urban monitoring.</li>
      <li><strong>Calibration</strong>: Addresses adaptability, robustness, and cross-domain generalization by integrating AI and human intelligence through collective intelligence frameworks, ensuring alignment with diverse and dynamic domain requirements.</li>
      <li><strong>Interaction</strong>: Fosters seamless collaboration between humans and AI, integrating small and large language models with HI to maintain explainability, interpretability, and responsiveness in high-stakes applications.</li>
    </ul>
