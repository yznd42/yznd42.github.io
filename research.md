My current research centers on designing collaborative frameworks that integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), with human intelligence (HI) to tackle complex, real-world problems in social contexts. Human intelligence contributes unique capabilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, abstract thinking, and the ability to learn from experience. These attributes provide valuable context, domain expertise, and human-centered insights essential for understanding the intricate social and environmental factors that shape societies. Conversely, AI excels at processing large-scale data, identifying latent patterns, and making predictions, offering scalability and computational power for addressing complex issues.

Motivated by the complementary yet distinct strengths of AI and HI, my research is built upon three core thrusts: human-AI collaborative *design*, *calibration*, and *interaction*.

- The *design* thrust leverages human-in-the-loop mechanisms to optimize neural architectures and hyperparameters efficiently, focusing on adaptive solutions for resource-constrained scenarios such as disaster response and urban monitoring.
- The *calibration* thrust addresses adaptability, robustness, and cross-domain generalization by integrating AI and human intelligence through collective intelligence frameworks, ensuring alignment with diverse and dynamic domain requirements.
- The *interaction* thrust fosters seamless collaboration between humans and AI, integrating small and large language models with HI to maintain explainability, interpretability, and responsiveness in high-stakes applications.

Below, I outline the technical contributions of these three thrusts, highlighting their impact on addressing societal challenges through human-AI collaboration.
