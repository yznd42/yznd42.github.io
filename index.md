## <span id="about">About Me</span>

I am a Teaching Assistant Professor at the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I also serve as a faculty affiliate of the Illinois Informatics Institute, the Center for Health Informatics, and the Social Sensing & Intelligence Lab. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at UIUC and a W. J. Cody Research Associate at Argonne National Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, an M.S. in Data Science from Indiana University Bloomington, and a B.S. in Software Engineering from Wuhan University.
