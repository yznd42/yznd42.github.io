## About Me


I am a Teaching Assistant Professor at the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I also serve as a faculty affiliate of the Illinois Informatics Institute, the Center for Health Informatics, and the Social Sensing & Intelligence Lab. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at UIUC and a W. J. Cody Research Associate at Argonne National Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, an M.S. in Data Science from Indiana University Bloomington, and a B.S. in Software Engineering from Wuhan University.


## Prospective Students


  I will be joining Miami University as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering starting in Fall 2025.
  <span style="color: red;">We have multiple fully funded positions available for Ph.D./M.S. students in Computer Science</span>,
     and we also welcome <span style="color: red;">students for on-campus/remote internship opportunities on collaborative research projects</span>. 
  If you are interested, please feel free to email me your CV and research interests/statement at <a href="mailto:yzhangnd.work@gmail.com">yzhangnd.work@gmail.com</a>.
