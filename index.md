## Biography


I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Miami University. Prior to this, I served as a Teaching Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Additionally, I also worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at UIUC and a W. J. Cody Research Associate at Argonne National Laboratory. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, an M.S. in Data Science from Indiana University Bloomington, and a B.E. in Software Engineering from Wuhan University.
