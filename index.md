## Biography


I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at [Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/). Prior to this, I served as a Teaching Assistant Professor at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/). Additionally, I also worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at UIUC and a W. J. Cody Research Associate at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/). I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/).
