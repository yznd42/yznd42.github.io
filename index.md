## About Me

Hello, this is Yang Zhang! I am a Teaching Assistant Professor and AI researcher at the School of Information Sciences (iSchool) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Notre Dame, advised by Dr. Dong Wang, an M.S. in Data Science from Indiana University Bloomington, and a B.E. in Software Engineering from Wuhan University. I am also affiliated with the Gradudate College, the Illinois Informatics Institute, and the Social Sensing & Intelligence Lab at UIUC. Previously, I worked as a W.J. Cody Research Associate at Argonne National Laboratory.
